# Curriculum-ViTeX
Curriculum ViTeX is a small application that will generate TeX files for your resume/CV in different templates, with you only having to maintain one master RML file ("Resume Markup Language" - an XML file which follows specific standards).  
Feel free to open an issue or fork/pull request if you find any bugs or have
any other enhancements to suggest.  
Please contact Muhammad Khan (mhk98@cornell.edu) for any other comments about the application.
##Documentation
For official documentation, use the _Makefile_ in the 'doc' folder to generate a PDF of the instruction manual.
##Extensibility
Curriculum ViTeX is easily extensible. Adding a new template is as easy as:
 1. Creating a new directory under the _templates_/ folder
 2. Writing the appropriate _structure.xml_ file (see documentation)
 3. Running the program with your new template
